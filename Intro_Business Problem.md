According to IIHS, in 2018 there were 36560 car-related deaths in the USA. Understanding root causes and developing predictive data-based models could play a significant role in reduction of the number of fatalities. Over the years ArcGIS has been collecting a lot of data on car accidents as well as factors that could influence the probability of a collision (e.g. road conditions, light conditions, weather and more). Using this dataset we will try to implement a model that would allow us to predict the probability of an accident when certain conditions are occuring (e.g. what is the probability of an accident today, given that it's a sunny morning with little traffic and I'm driving from Seattle to Mt. Vernon). This could later be integrated into GPS solutions as a value added services that would warn drivers about potential danger and re-route them accordingly (if desired).
